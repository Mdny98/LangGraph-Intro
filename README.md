# LangGraph Agent Tutorial â€“ Simple and Complex AI Agents

This repository contains a tutorial project for building two different types of AI agents using [LangGraph](https://github.com/techwithtim/LangGraph-Tutorial) and the Groq API:

## ðŸ§  Agents Overview

### 1. Simple Agent â€“ Chatbot
A basic conversational AI agent that uses:
- **Groq API** for fast inference
- **LangGraph** for managing the flow

It acts like a straightforward chatbot for general-purpose conversations.

### 2. Complex Agent â€“ Emotional & Logical Assistant
An advanced AI agent that routes user prompts to either:
- An **Emotional Assistant**, or
- A **Logical Assistant**

The routing is done based on the nature of the input, allowing for more context-aware and appropriate responses.

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- Groq integration for LLM access
- LangGraph to manage agent behavior and flow
- Prompt routing logic in the complex agent
- Inspired by [TechWithTim's LangGraph tutorial](https://github.com/techwithtim/LangGraph-Tutorial)
